# Colophon

## Colours
All colours pass WCAG 2.2 as well as the unreleased WCAG 3 contrast requirements. Here is a [direct link to my Accessible Palette](https://accessiblepalette.com/?lightness=98,92,82,72,47,36,25,14,7.5,4.3&a0ba97=0,0&0F0F0F=0,0), the colour palette generator I used to meet both standards.

All multi-line syntax highlighting is <a href="https://github.com/mjio/boron.tmtheme">Boron</a> with a custom background colour.</p>

## Tools
I built this site on [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a Rust-based Static Site Generator (SSG).

## Typography
Paragraphs use [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/), a font created by the Braille Institute.
