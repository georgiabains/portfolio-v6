# About

I started to code back in 2014 by editing Tumblr themes to my liking. That evolved into making my own themes from scratch, picking up contract and internship work during university (a side-quest where I double majored in Cognitive Science and Art History), to making e-commerce websites built on Shopify. I currently work for [fusefabric](https://www.fusefabric.com/), an enterprise Shopify Partner.

I first learnt about accessibility when I was contracted to build two microsites for the University of Toronto. My [previous Tumblr themes](https://wonderfullythemes.tumblr.com/themes) seemed to compete with one another in an effort to be as inaccessible as possible (low contrast, cramming information into the smallest pixels possible, and relying on hover interactions for _everything_) and I very quickly needed to familiarise myself with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA).

Turns out that was my calling.

I love learning about accessibility, and actively seek out different discussions, problems, solutions and topics to learn more and improve my work. This blog is my way of sharing that knowledge, and discussing some topics where I struggled to find resources that I could understand.

In my personal time, I enjoy video games, reading, crocheting and knitting.
