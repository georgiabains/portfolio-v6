# Accessibility Statement

## Measures to support accessibility

I take the following measures to ensure accessibility of my blog:
- Include accessibility from the ideation step of all features
- Integrate accessibility into all code written
- Engage with continual accessibility training

## Conformance status

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. This blog is fully conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Fully conformant means that the content fully conforms to the accessibility standard without any exceptions.

## Additional accessibility considerations

I use (and continue to use) the following methods to test website accessibility:
- Automated browser-based testing (axe Dev Tools, Google Lighthouse, Firefox's builtin accessibility checker, and more)
- Colour contrast testing
- Manual keyboard testing
- MacOS VoiceOver
- Windows Narrator
- NVDA

## Technical specifications

Accessibility relies on the following technologies to work with the particular combination of web browser and any assistive technologies or plugins installed on your computer:
- HTML
- WAI-ARIA
- CSS

These technologies are relied upon for conformance with the accessibility standards used.
Assessment approach

I assessed the accessibility of my blog by the following approaches:
- Self-evaluation
