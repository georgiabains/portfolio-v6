# Hi, I'm Georgia

I'm a frontend developer specialising in website accessibility. I stumbled upon web development a decade ago, and have been fascinated by it ever since. I currently work for [fusefabric](https://www.fusefabric.com/), a Shopify enterprise partner, where I'm leading the implementation of accessibility standards and practices.
